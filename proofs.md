# Proofs
Show that you know what you are doing and that your ideas work.

## Contrapositive
Switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating both. 
For example, the contrapositive of "If it is raining then the grass is wet" is "If the grass is not wet then it is not raining."
x -> y
-y -> -x

## Contradiction
In logic and mathematics proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or validity of a proposition by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.

## Cases
Have a set of possible outcomes or something

## Induction
n = k, prove that n+1 also holds
